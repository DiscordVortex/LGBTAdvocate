          <p>
           Sexuality for some people is not clear cut - it's a spectrum. And wherever you sit on that spectrum is completely fine.

Figuring out your sexuality isn't a matter of gathering evidence, it's about how you feel. It's normal to be sexually attracted to the same sex sometimes - it doesn't necessarily mean you're gay.

But if you've felt this way very strongly for a long time, you could be bisexual or gay. Some people know from an early age, while others need to explore and experiment to understand more about how they feel.</p>

		 <h1 class="page-title">What does it mean?</h1>
         <p>Sexual orientation (or sexuality) is about who you have sexual feelings towards.
Heterosexuals (people who are straight) are people who only fancy members of the opposite sex.
Homosexuals (people who are gay) only fancy members of the same sex. Girls who fancy other girls can also be called lesbians.
Bisexuals are attracted to both sexes.
Asexuals experience attraction, but do not experience sexual attraction or sexual desire.

However, as a teenager, your sexual feelings can be very intense and it's completely natural for your attention to jump between different people - and different genders - quite frequently.

This can be confusing. It can also be exciting. Enjoy and explore at your own pace. Sexuality doesn't develop overnight, so don't be in too much of a hurry to put a label on yours.</p>
