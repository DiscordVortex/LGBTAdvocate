              <h3>Coming Out</h3>
              <p>You don't have to tell anyone you're lesbian, gay, bisexual or trans if you don't want to. It's up to you who you tell, but you might feel happier if you can be honest about who you really are. Sometimes it can be hard to know if people will 'accept' you if your struggling send us a message via our emal (Lgbtadvocateteam@outlook.com) and one of our support teams will respond as soon as we are avalible.

                If you feel like you are going to be disowned or not accepted just make sure your old enough to provide for yourself like having a Job and owning a house etc, before you tell your parents or guardians. 

The best thing to do is tell someone you trust, a parent, guardian or even a friend. If your worried about being disowned get support. 

- Don't feel pressured. 
- Do it when you're ready. 
- Tell your friends, if they are being offencive or disrespectful they arn't your friends.
- Be honest. 
- Be yourself - be honest and respectful to your feelings.
- You are you, no one else.</p>

              <h3>LGBTQ Hate</h3>
              <p>Homophobia/Transphobia is a type of discrimination over someone's sexuality or gender identity, sometimes it can be violent or abusive. If your worried or experiencing this type of bullying you can get help.</p>
						  <p>How to cope with Homophobia/Transphobia:</p>
						  <p>Sometimes it can be difficult to cope with, sometimes it's best to ignore it. It's not wrong to be Gay/Lesbian/Bi/Trans/Etc, you're never alone. Sometimes talking to friends and family about it could be a good idea, if it's at school talk to a trusted adult. 
              If it turns violent or physical, call the police.</p>

              <h3>How to tell if someone is Gay, bi etc</h3>
              <p>Sometimes it's difficult to know if someone is part of the LGBTQ community, the best thing to do is to talk to them, or just watch for certain signs. Maybe they have something they wear like a bracelet or badge on their bag etc. 

              Talking to them is most probably the obvious option, but we know thats difficult, if you need advice on what to say etc, check out our contact page.</p>
